## What are React lifecycle methods?

`You can think of React lifecycle methods as the series of events that happen from the birth of a React component to its death.`

Every component in React goes through a lifecycle of events. I like to think of them as going through a cycle of birth, growth, and death.

### `Mounting 
      Birth of your component`<br />
### `Update
      Growth of your component`<br />
### `Unmount
      Death of your component`<br />
      
Now that we understand the series of lifecycle events letâ€™s learn more about how they work.

## React Lifecycle Methods

### render()

The __render()__ method is the most used lifecycle method. You will see it in all React classes. This is because render() is the only required method within a class component in React.

As the name suggests it handles the rendering of your component to the UI. It happens during the mounting and updating of your component.

Below is an example of a simple render() in React.
